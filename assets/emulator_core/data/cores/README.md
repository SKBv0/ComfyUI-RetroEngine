# Emulator Cores

The emulator core files required for ComfyUI-RetroEngine are not included directly in this repository to keep the repository size manageable and to ensure users can access the latest versions.

You can download the necessary core files from the official EmulatorJS repository.

For more information and to obtain the core files, please visit the [EmulatorJS cores directory](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS/blob/main/data/cores/README.md).

Place the downloaded core files (typically `.data`, `.js`, and `.wasm` files associated with each emulator) into this directory (`assets/emulator_core/data/cores/`).
